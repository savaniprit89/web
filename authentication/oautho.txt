third parth o-autho


i am build bracebook
when i signup in it i don't have any friends in it
so we ask them to access permission of facebook so we can tell them which facebook friends are using bracebook


on signup page we have option of signup with facebook
once person click bracebook make get request to facebook asking them friends of that person
facebook return post request of name and email of friends
now we can compare with our database of users and give which users are common
**********************************
OAuth---open authorisation

steps-1 granular access levels
when user login with facebook ,we can request specific things from facebook
profile,email etc

step-2 read/read-write access
only read profile,email
or wordpress have to post to facebook account means write operation

step-3 revoke access
user can revoke access of bracebook by going to facebook account and revoking


how it works

step-1
set up your app

step-2
redirect to authenticate

when user click login with facebook step 3

step-3
goes to page user log in facebook

step-4
grant permission
now user need to grant permission which bracebook need of facebook

step-5
recieve authoriasation code
if they successfully done it then our website recieves Auth code
these auth code allow us to check that they have login

 further we can exchange auth code with facebook and we recieve access token
and save that access token in database

auth code--single ticket in cinema ---means single time login into website
access token---yearly pass for cinema----means user can now multiple time login with facebook not every time grant permssion 

auth code---successfully manage to login with facebook
access token ---acess piece of information of friend and profile
