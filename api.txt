then
if(response.statuscode==200){
res.sendfile(__dirname,"/success.txt")
}
else{
res.sendfile(__dirname,"/failure.txt")}




if failure page has try again button then pressing on it
app.post("/failure",(req,re)=>{
res.redirect("/");
})


if we deposit on server then we have not specify port because it can run on any port so 

we have to specify
app.listen(process.env.PORT||3000,()=>{})//here process.env is for heroku server and it can differ
from server to server and we can locally host on 3000 port
