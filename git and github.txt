git--local repository
github-remote

if we have file in working directory then add in stagging area
here if are not commited so to add use git commit and add to local repository
now we make changes in file then that are not reflected into local repository file
so save changes we have to commit
and we have revert changes then gitcheckout so file that in local have text that will be now on working directory files
 
if we have to push on remote directory then simply git push


and we have to get files from remote to local then git pull


now any one want to download my file then git clone


*****
